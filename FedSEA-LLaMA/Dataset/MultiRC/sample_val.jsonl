Force can cause an object at rest to start moving. Forces can cause objects to speed up or slow down. Forces can cause a moving object to stop. Forces can also cause a change in direction. In short, forces cause changes in motion. The moving object may change its speed, its direction, or both. We know that changes in motion require a force. We know that the size of the force determines the change in motion. How much an objects motion changes when a force is applied depends on two things. It depends on the strength of the force. It also depends on the objects mass. Think about some simple tasks you may regularly do. You may pick up a baseball. This requires only a very small force.

Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic.

Mr. Allan did not have that affection for him which Mrs. Allan had. He did not understand the boy's peculiar and erratic nature, and was particularly displeased when he found that Edgar had run into debt at college. There was an angry scene between the two, and Edgar was told that he must leave the university and go into the counting-room. It appears that he made some attempt to tie himself down to figures and accounts and business routine; but as he had not been brought up to this kind of life, he soon tired of it, and decided to go into the world to seek his own fortune. He went to Boston, where he published a volume of poetry. In the preface to this volume, Poe says that the poems were written before he was fourteen. Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were. While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them. This gentleman advised against it on the ground that it would make Edgar conceited,--a fault from which he was already suffering.

Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was \"toi kratistoi\"--\"to the strongest\". Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him. Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \"The Successors\" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: Ptolemaic Egypt, Selucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon.

{"idx": 8, "version": 1.1, "passage": {"text": "Albert Bandura OC (/baen'dU@r@/; born December 4, 1925) is a psychologist who is the David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science in Psychology at Stanford University. For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment. Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others. An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher. Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action. The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children. A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one. Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time. In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA). He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48. Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.

{"idx": 11, "version": 1.1, "passage": {"text": "Five independent Salt Lake organizations that provide legal services to the poor, ethnic minorities, seniors and people with disabilities have joined together to acquire a west-side downtown building where they will have their offices. The new Community Legal Center at 205 N. 400 West is a project of \"And Justice for All,\" which, until this venture, has been a joint fund-raising campaign by an alliance of the non-profit providers of free legal services. \"And Justice for All,\" which solicits donations primarily from Utah lawyers and foundations, was the first joint fund-raising campaign of legal services agencies in the country, and the Community Legal Center is the first joint office project of public service law groups. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake, the Disability Law Center, the Multi-Cultural Legal Center, the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility, and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies. All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room. The building is close in, across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway. It has its own parking, something that's hard to find downtown and which has been a problem for staff as well as clients. Owning and sharing the building and not paying rent times five will save the non-profit agencies about $375,000 each year. My assistant, Charity Christenson, pointed out that the shared facility will also be efficient for those needing legal services. No longer will a woman desperate for a protective order, for example, have to run all over town trying to find the right agency. After the tour, we found Jaye Olafson at the cookies and brownies reception on the first floor. Jaye and her husband, Erik, own Tomax Technologies and were the sellers of the building. Jaye explained how much of the renovation had been merely uncovering what was already there. The hardwood floors, wooden ceilings and brick and stone interior walls were all hidden behind coverings and old paint. She loves the building, and they only moved out because the business had outgrown the space. So they renovated the old Sweet Candy Company building for Tomax. The Olafsons are delighted with the new owners. The building had been like home, she explained, and so it was important who would be living there.

{"idx": 12, "version": 1.1, "passage": {"text": "The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense. Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs. As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements.

Like ice wedging, abrasion does not change the rock into another type of rock. With abrasion, one rock or piece of sediment bumps against another rock. Rocks dont normally roll around on their own, so why do they move? There are a couple of reasons a rock may move. Gravity can cause rocks to move. They may roll downhill or fall off a cliff. As they roll down a hill, they bump into each other. Maybe a moving rock hits a rock that is not moving at the bottom of the hill. Moving water causes rocks and sediment to move. Rocks are bounced along the bottom and bump against one another. As they collide, they begin to chip away at each other. Angular rocks become more rounded with each collision. Strong winds cause abrasion. The wind carries sediment. This sediment is thrown against other rocky surfaces by the wind. It is like sand-blasting a rock.

{"idx": 14, "version": 1.1, "passage": {"text": "Maximilian's death came at a time when Durer was concerned he was losing \"my sight and freedom of hand\" (perhaps caused by arthritis) and increasingly affected by the writings of Martin Luther. In July 1520 Durer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, Charles V, who was to be crowned at Aachen. Durer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the Rhine to Cologne and then to Antwerp, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in silverpoint, chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of Stefan Lochner), Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Bruges (where he saw Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges), Ghent (where he admired van Eyck's altarpiece), and Zeeland. Durer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much. This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time. Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented. While providing valuable documentary evidence, Durer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, Durer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, Margaret of Austria, but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met Bernard van Orley, Jan Provoost, Gerard Horenbout, Jean Mone, Joachim Patinir and Tommaso Vincidor, though he did not, it seems, meet Quentin Matsys. At the request of Christian II of Denmark, Durer went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait. There he saw \"The things which have been sent to the king from the golden land\"--the Aztec treasure that Hernan Cortes had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico. Durer wrote that this treasure \"was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins\". Durer also appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities, and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the East Indies. Having secured his pension, Durer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness--perhaps malaria --which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.
